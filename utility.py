# This script will prompt the user to enter the directory path and then iterate through each file in that directory. For each file, it will ask the user to enter a new name, and then rename the file with the new name and same extension.
# You can save this script to a file (e.g., rename_files.py) and run it from the command line using python rename_files.py.

# üëáüèªThis code defines a Discord bot that listens for the !rename-file command. When a user runs this command and attaches a file and provides a new name, the bot downloads the file, renames it, and sends the renamed file back to the user.
# You'll need to replace YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your actual Discord bot token.
# Note that this code assumes you have the discord.py library installed. If you don't, you can install it with pip install discord.py.
# Also, keep in mind that this is just an example and you may want to add additional error handling and features to your bot. üëáüèª
